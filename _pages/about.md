I am a current master's student at the University of Washington, studying biostatistics. At a high level, my interests involve applying statistical methodologies to public health questions. I am especially interested in studying social determinants of health in order to lessen the burden health for marginalized communities. When I am not tinkering with R code, I enjoy dancing, reading by the lake, and playing board games with friends!
