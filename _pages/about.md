I am a graduating master's student at the University of Washington, studying biostatistics. At a high level, my interests involve applying statistical methodologies to answer public health questions. I am especially interested in how we can draw causal conclusions from observational data in order to study social determinants of health and health disparities, with the goal of lessening the burden health for marginalized communities. When I am not tinkering with R code, I enjoy dancing, reading by the lake, and playing board games with friends!
