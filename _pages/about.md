I am a first year PhD student in biostatistics at McGill University. I am supervised by Dr. Erica Moodie, and I am also working with Dr. Alexandra Pokomandy on research involving the Quebec HIV Cohort, Chronic Virus Illness Service. At a high level, my interests involve applying statistical methodologies to answer public health questions. I am especially interested in how we can draw causal conclusions from observational data in order to study social determinants of health and health disparities, with the goal of lessening the burden health for marginalized communities. When I am not tinkering with R code, I enjoy dancing, reading by the lake, and playing board games with friends!
